# Description:

Before I dive into description of this project, it important I let you know that this project was gotten from a video I watched on Youtube. All I did was to use my own method to replicate the same thing I learn and then added a few features to it. Here is the link to the video <https://youtu.be/dam0GPOAvVI>

Easynotepad is a simple web based notepad in your web browser. With Easynotepad you can create notes (ideas, to-do list, or any other plain text) that you would like to write just in a web browser. This online notepad saves your notes in a database so even if you close your browser after you have save your text, you'll still have your note intact. It also enables you with the features of being able to delete your note with ease But you cannot undo deleted files so you must be sure that you really want to delete any note before doing so. In addition, Easynotepad makes sure your notes are safe and secure by prompting you the users to sign up or login depending on if you are a new user or an existing users respectively. So no random person can assess your note without knowing your password and email addresses. But just in case you find out that someone else knows your password this online notepad also makes it possible for you to change your password to any password of your choice and also making sure that password is nothing less than seven characters.

Easynotepad is not a text editor and has no text formatting. If you need a real multifunctional special test editor with test formatting tools etc., you can fine a lot of different applications for you special needs. Also Easynotepad is not a replacement for your real paper notepad but can be used up to some extent as a means of backing up your text.

The first route is the "/" route which is the homepage and to view the homepage the login_required must return true and this can only be true if the session is not empty. The "/" route has two methods namely "GET" and "POST", so when there is a post request the program should insert note into the database but the when there is a get request the program shoulk select some data from the database which is to be displayed to the user. Next is the "/login" route, Before you login a new user
