#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/W8eS3rSm7QU>
#### Description:
The project is a simple web app, whose basic purpose is to give its users the room to be able to write their note and have those notes displayed back to them on the main page. This site consist of only four pages namely(login, sign up, home and change password). the site was built using Html, JavaScript and Python for the backend.<br />
The UI was designed using Bootstrap only. Due to the way the app was designed, it's impossible to view the homepage without login in first. So if you are visiting the site for the first time you will be directed to the login page But you can't login if you do not have an account so navigating to the sign up page will be the only option and this can be done by clicking on sign up at the nav bar. Immediately after registering you will be directed to the homepage which is where you have the ability to write down you note and also have you previous notes displayed back to you. At the nav bar in the home page, there you have the log out and the change password. If you click on the log out you are automatically logged out while if you click on the change password you will be directed to a page where you will fill in your old password, new password and confirmation of the new password and by submiting the form your password automatically is going to change to your new password.<br />
app.py is responsible for making sure the user is only logged in before they can view the homepage. It's gives the command as to what should be done on the page. Helpers.py is where you have <br />
database.db is the file that stores all the data from the users including their notes. the .db file was created using sqlite3
